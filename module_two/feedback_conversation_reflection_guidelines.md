# Feedback Conversation Reflection Guidelines

* Date of feedback conversation: 7/5/2018

* How did you prepare for the conversation?

  Light journaling, however we also set the time for our discussion more than a day out, so I had time to collect my thoughts internally as well.

* How did the conversation go for you? What was easy about the conversation? What was more difficult?

  I came out of the discussion feeling good about it, as I felt we all took seriously the need for feedback.  However, the most difficult part of the discussion was finding solid coaching feedback.  I expressed, along with my group mates, that I had thoroughly enjoyed our process and felt we had each been earnestly trying to embrace one another's ideas, work ethics and work styles.  We each expressed that we would love coaching feedback to be able to continue to grow, but we could not provide anything that wasn't forced.  

* What principles of feedback did you use in the conversation?

  I attempted to be as specific as possible with each of my pieces of input as I have previously received feedback that I am often vague.  Many other concerns, like being mindful of triggers and providing actionable feedback lend themselves much better to coaching feedback, which we struggled to provided substantively.

* What is your biggest challenge when giving feedback to someone else? How do you want to overcome that challenge?

  Coaching feedback, I feel awkward doing it, I imagine it comes from non-confrontational tendencies.  I want to overcome this challenge by forcing myself to provide some coaching feedback in each of these closing conversation throughout the rest of Turing.  However, based on my experience yesterday, I am aware that this will require me to be actively considering what kind of feedback I can give throughout the project.

* How would you describe your ability to communicate feedback? How has this experience affected your communication skills?

  Verbose describes well every aspect of my speech, feedback not excepted.  Often I believe this prevents my feedback from being easily digestible and in many cases gives the air of insincerity.

* Any other comments:

  I expect this experience will not be representative of the general experience as this was a uniquely easy group work experience, so I am looking forward with some anxiety to this same process in a more difficult or discordant group.
